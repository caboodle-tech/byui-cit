# COMPONENTS
The files in this directory are needed for the JamED CLI application to work, they should not need to edited with the exception of the `cli.js` file. If you add your own custom compilers to the `compilers` directory you will need to reference them in the `cli.js` file. Follow the instructions (comments) in the `cli.js` file on how to do this correctly.
