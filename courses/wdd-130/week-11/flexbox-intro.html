                    <p>
                        The final project template that you have been provided for this course uses a mix of CSS grid — which you have already learned — and CSS flexbox. This week your instructor will demonstrate the basics of CSS flexbox in class. This assignment will help you learn flexbox in greater depth. As you study the resources below and complete the required assignment make sure to note any questions you have. Coming to class with questions will allow your instructor to demonstrate the answers live in class.

                                The following videos compare CSS flexbox with CSS grid. Both methods of page layout are useful but each has its own strengths and weaknesses:

                                    When should you use flexbox and when should you use CSS grids? For a long time we've been using HTML tables and floats to position boxes where we want them on the website, but now we have flexbox and CSS grid.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is not a guide of how to use either of them, there are plenty of guides out there, this is more when to use what. To be clear, the CSS grid can do a lot of things the flexbox can do, and flexbox can do a lot of things that CSS Grid can do. But in some areas the CSS grid is better and more convenient, and in other areas flexbox is more convenient and better.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Flexbox is really good at aligning things on one axis. For example, the X axis called the Row, or the Y axis called the Column. But that only works in one dimension, if you want to do something, well like a grid using both X and Y axis, like this, CSS grid is much better. CSS grid is also much better like a whole page layout, imagine if this is your side menu, this is your content, and this is your footer, I would use CSS grid for this.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But where they really shine is when you use them together. For example, you can use, flexbox inside of the CSS grid. If this is your website and you used the grid system layout for this, and this is a grid layout item, you can put flexbox [inside the item] to align things inside your footer or inside your grid item.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And same thing goes with CSS grid inside of a flexbox, if you align this using flexbox, you can actually structure... have the same structure as you have in your website, inside the flexbox item. Alright. Honestly anyway you want.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So this is how you should use them, you should use them together, and should learn both. Flexbox has slightly better browser support because its a little bit older than CSS grid, uh but I will link in the description down below on a full list of what supports what? But overall, this is how you use them.

                                To practice flexbox you will need to complete all 24 levels of <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexbox Froggy</a>. Remember to do all your work on the same computer, otherwise your progress will not be saved. <strong>Do not click the next button on level 24!</strong> There is a bug that will wipe your progress. Make sure to take your screenshot before completing level 24.

                                Another great resource you should review (that is optional) is <a href="http://www.flexboxdefense.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexbox Defense</a>. Using your flexbox skills you will place defensive towers to defend yourself from invading enemies.

                                <li>Take a screenshot of the entire level board and submit it to this assignment.</li>
