                        For this class you will need to signup for several free online accounts and install the required code editor. Do this as soon as possible. <strong>Please note that a Chromebook is not acceptable for this class</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Assignment</h2>

                            <p>
                                Signup for a free <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub account</a> (if you do not have one already) with your student email. As a student you will be given free access to a Pro Account. Once your account has been created visit <a href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">GitHub Education</a> and click on the <mark>Get Benifits</mark> button to activate your pro account.

                                Signup for a free <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glitch account</a> (if you do not have one already) with your student email <strong>OR</strong> by linking to your GitHub account. If you create a new account with your email you will have to verify your account by clicking on a link sent to this email. sometimes the BYUI spam filters reject emails from Glitch, if your unable to complete the Glitch verification because of this you may create an account with your personal email; it is recommenced to link Glitch with your GitHub account to save your from all this hassle.

                                        For the privacy conscious you can install and use <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VS Codium</a> instead; you will need to figure out the correct install for your machine on your own.
