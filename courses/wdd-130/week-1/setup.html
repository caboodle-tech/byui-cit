                        For this class you will need to signup for several free online accounts and install the required code editor. Do this as soon as possible. <strong>Please note that a Chromebook is not acceptable for this class</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Assignment</h2>

                            <p>
                                Signup for a free <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub account</a> (if you do not have one already) with your student email. As a student you will be given free access to a Pro Account. Once your account has been created visit <a href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">GitHub Education</a> and click on the <mark>Get Benifits</mark> button to activate your pro account.

                            <p>
                                Signup for a free <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glitch account</a> (if you do not have one already) with your student email <strong>OR</strong> by linking to your GitHub account. If you create a new account with your email you will have to verify your account by clicking on a link sent to this email. sometimes the BYUI spam filters reject emails from Glitch, if your unable to complete the Glitch verification because of this you may create an account with your personal email; it is recommenced to link Glitch with your GitHub account to save your from all this hassle.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VS Code</a> on your machine. You will need to add the Live Server extension to VS Code. Your instructor will demo in class how to install any additional extensions needed for this class.
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    <p>
                                        For the privacy conscious you can install and use <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VS Codium</a> instead; you will need to figure out the correct install for your machine on your own.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                If you would like to install extension(s) yourself before class the following video will help. Please note that this video does not support Closed Captions (CC). If you are in need of closed captioning please note that this video is not required for class and your instructor will do a live demonstration of the same material covered in this video.
