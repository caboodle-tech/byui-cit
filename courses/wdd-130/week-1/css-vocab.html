                    <h1>CSS Vocabulary</h1>
                    <p>
                        Learning the vocabulary for CSS will be vital for your success in this class. Like any language it is impossible to learn everything all at once, you should however memorize the following core terms. You will have a hard time making sense of the instruction given in this course if you don't understand these terms.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Core Terms</h2>
                            <p>
                                Make sure you have read, understood, and memorized the following terms:
                            </p>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>
                                    Selector
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    How you specify to the browser which HTML element(s) should be changed. We will focus primarily on 3 kinds of selectors in this class:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>element</li>
                                        <li>.class</li>
                                        <li>#id</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    For example, if we have the following HTML:
<pre class="lang-html">
<code class="lang-html">&lt;p&gt;No class or id on this paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green"&gt;This paragraph has a class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green" id="paragraph3"&gt;This paragraph has a class and an id&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
                                    We could select all of the paragraphs by using the element selector <mark>p</mark>. Notice that there is no preface such as <mark>.</mark> or <mark>#</mark>, we simply use the tag name.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We could select just the second and third paragraphs by using the class attribute on them as a selector like this: <mark>.green</mark> Notice that we preface the class name with a period this time.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We could also select just the last paragraph by using its ID as a selector like this: <mark>#paragraph3</mark> Notice that we preface the ID with a number sign (hashtag) this time.
<pre class="lang-css">
<code class="lang-css">p /* element selector: all paragraphs */
.green /* class selector: all paragraphs with an attribute class="green" */
#paragraph3 /* id selector: the paragraph with the attribute id="paragraph3" */
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Property
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    What we want to change about the element(s) selected by our selector. For example:
<pre class="lang-css">
<code class="lang-css">background-color
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Value
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    How we want to change a property. For example here we provide a value of green for the background-color property:
<pre class="lang-css">
<code class="lang-css">background-color: green;
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Declaration
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    A combination of a property and it's value with a colon. Declarations must 
<pre class="lang-css">
<code class="lang-css">background-color: green;
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Declaration Block
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    One or more declarations will be combined into a block using curly braces ({}):
<pre class="lang-css">
<code class="lang-css">{
    background-color: green;
    margin: 5px;    
}
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Rule (or Rule-set)
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    A rule is the combination of a selector and declaration block. The example below would select all elements with a class="green" and turn their background green:
<pre class="lang-css">
<code class="lang-css">.green {
    background-color: green;
    margin: 5px;    
}
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Units
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Many properties require a value with units. Some units are absolute meaning that they are always the same size. Other units are relative meaning that their size changes based on something else; like the size of the text or the width or the browser or an element. Common CSS units are: px (absolute), em (relative, based off of font size), and % (relative, based off of width).

                            </dl>
                        </li>
