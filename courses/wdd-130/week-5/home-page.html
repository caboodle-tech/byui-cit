                    <p>
                        In this assignment we are going to complete your Glitch sites home page. We did not tell you earlier but the wireframe assignment was the start of your home page. You should have completed building the HTML for the home page page during the week 3 wireframe assignment; the <mark>wireframe.html</mark> page. Use the HTML from the <mark>wireframe.html</mark> page and incorporate it into the HTML for your home page (<mark>index.html</mark>). Yes, this means you will delete a lot of the content from your home page. Do not delete the head section. You may have to merge some of the pages content.
                    </p>
                    <div class="callout">

                        <p>
                            What you are doing here is a common occurrence in industry. Someone will give you a template or code file and you will copy that into the design you are creating. In this assignment <mark>wireframe.html</mark> is like a template file we have been given. All we need to do is copy that template into our <mark>index.html</mark> (home) page and then work on completing it according to the wireframe.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            <p>
                                The design team has not had time to send you an updated wireframe but you have been told the design is 99% the same. Later in the day you final receive the following email: 
                            </p>
                            <hr>

                                We have decided we will need the following links in the header navigation. The sites logo should act as the link back to the home page. Please make sure these are the only header links in the production site:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="smaller indent">
                                <li>About Us</li>
                                <li>Services</li>
                                <li>FAQ</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="indent">
                                We have also decided not to use social media links in the footer, instead can you please replace them with these links:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="smaller indent">

                                Make these changes in the HTML for your <mark>index.html</mark> page now. Keep in mind that the <mark>About Us</mark> page is not the same as your <mark>About Me</mark> page which already exists. You may want to create empty pages for every link that does not have an existing page already. If you choose not to create empty pages now, make sure to still include the links in your HTML.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Add Content</h2>
                            <p>
                                Before we start to style our page it will be helpful to have content in place. When a website is missing content it makes styling hard because images and text usually alter the feel and flow of a web page. Web Developers usually use place holder images and text to mimic what the final site might look like. Thankfully for us, the design team has already created the content. Take a look at the <a href="../dry-oar.html" target="_blank">Dry Oar Content</a> page to see what we have to work with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You will not use all of this pre-generated content and you may decide to create some of you own. Go ahead and add the appropriate text content and images to your home page following the wireframe design. A copy of the wireframe is in the next section if you need it.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
                            <p>
                                Now that you have the sites logo, links, images, and content in place lets actually organize the page to match the wireframe. If you forgot what the wireframe looked like you can review it in the collapsible section below:
                            </p>
                            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Wireframe Image</button>
                            <div class="collapsible-content">
                                <p>
                                    <img src="assets/wireframe.jpg">
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Using your knowledge of CSS grid layouts, add CSS rule-sets and rules to your <mark>styles.css</mark> file to complete the home page. When you are done with this step your home page's layout should match the wireframe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you would like a refresher on how CSS grid works, W3Schools has a 3 part tutorial on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Grid Layout</a>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Publish</h2>
                            <p>
                                If you worked locally in VS Code for this assignment make sure your final code and files have been added to Glitch; don't forget to upload images into your Glitch project and update their <code>src</code>. View the live Glitch site to make sure the web page displays correctly. Pay special attention to whether your styles are displaying correctly and all images are loading. Once verified, submit the URL to your live home page in Canvas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Don't forget you should validate your code before <em>sending it to production</em> (putting it on the internet for everyone to see). For HTML files you can use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> and for CSS files you can use the <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C CSS Validation Service</a>.
                            </p>

                                    You will be graded at your instructor's or teaching assistant's discretion on how well you followed instructions and made your home page match the wireframe.
