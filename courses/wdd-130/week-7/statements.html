                    <p>
                        Part of the planning process for a new website or company includes the creation of several important statements. At a minimum they usually consist of the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="smaller">
                        <li>
                            Purpose Statement
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Audience Statement
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Misson Statement
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Starting the planning process with these statements helps keep everyone on the same page throughout the entire development process. These statements also help us quickly realize when we might be working out of scope, meaning doing things that are not directly progressing our statements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the planning stage creating succinct statements can also save us large amounts of time. Think of the process like a construction job for a new building. If we just start building without plans in place can you imagine the issues we might run into? We could accidentally build the building to big, not leaving enough room for parking. Walls that need to be load-bearing could be forgotten, causing a collapse of the building. Lights, plumping, doors, and windows could be placed incorrectly or missing entirely. In simple terms, taking the time to properly plan and create statements is like starting new construction with detailed lot plans and blueprints for what you hope to build. Changes may still happen, but in a far safer and less time consuming manner.

                    <h2>Assignment:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
                            <p>
                                From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which content you should put on the site it is critical to determine the purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Build Revenue:</strong> Build revenues for your
                                    new or existing business.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Share Information:</strong> Share corporate or
                                    educational information.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Share Opinions:</strong> Share opinions on a subject.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Share Personal Interests:</strong> Share personal interests with family and friends.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be more than <em>my teacher is making me do this</em>. One problem we have is the purpose really needs to be defined by the <mark>site owner</mark> and not the <mark>site builder</mark>. So for this step and the following steps imagine that you are the owner of the business and have decided that it is time for you to have an online presence. Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for the website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your purpose statement should be a minimum of 100 words. There is no maximum limit, but remember to be succinct.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
                            <p>
                                Another important factor to keep in mind when planning a website, is the audience for the site. Remember, that websites are all about content. The purpose helps define what content you should include, and the content should target your specific audience or audiences (websites can have more than one).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Write a statement specifically identifying your target audience. Try to answer these questions:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation, interests, etc).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    What do they want?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    What are their needs that aren't being met?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Your audience statement should be a minimum of 100 words. There is no maximum limit, but remember to be succinct.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                            <p>
                                A mission statement, sometimes called a value statement, is a short statement of why an organization exists. The mission statement includes or addresses what the organizations overall goal is, what kind of product or service it provides, its primary customers or market, and its geographical region of operation. Sometimes a mission statement my include a short statement of the organization's values or philosophies, a business's main competitive advantages, or a desired future state (the vision) of the organization.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement">
                                <p>
                                    A mission is not simply a description of an organization by an external party, but an expression, made by its leaders, of their desires and intent for the organization. The purpose of a mission statement is to communicate the organisation's purpose and direction to its employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders. A mission statement also creates a sense of identity for its employees. Organizations normally do not change their mission statements over time, since they define their continuous, ongoing purpose and focus.

                                Write a mission statement for your website. You may want to research various companies online and use their mission statements as inspiration for your own. Your mission statement should be a minimum of 100 words. There is no maximum limit, but remember to be succinct.
