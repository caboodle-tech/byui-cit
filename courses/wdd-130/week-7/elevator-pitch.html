                        The Final project for this class will be for you to create a website on a topic of your choice. There will also be content available for a semi-fictitious shipping company Allen Ship Center, but you are encouraged to come up with your own idea. We will start building this site next week, in order to prepare for that we need to start planning now. Over the next few class sessions we will continue to learn web fundamentals as we prepare and build a Site Plan for our final personal site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first step in the planning process is to determine the purpose of the site, so this week you need to settle on your idea for what you want to do. You should then create an elevator pitch for your personal site idea. Creating an elevator pitch can be a good gauge of the quality of your ideas and your enthusiasm for them.

                        <h2>What is an Elevator Pitch?</h2>
                        <p>
                            An elevator pitch is a brief persuasive speech that you can use to spark interest in what you or your organization does. You can also use one to create interest in a project, idea, or product. It should be succinct while still conveying important information.

                            <p>
                                The 9 C's of Elevator Pitches are summarized below. You should also read the full <a href="https://elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html" target="_blank">Elevator Pitch 101</a> essay by Chris O'Leary.

                                    An effective elevator pitch contains as few words as possible,
                                    but no fewer.

                                    Rather than being filled with acronyms, MBA-speak, and
                                    ten-dollar words, an effective elevator pitch can be understood
                                    by your grandparents, your spouse, and your children.
                                </dd>

                                    An effective elevator pitch explains the problem your Solution
                                    solves.
                                </dd>

                                    An effective elevator pitch explains why you are qualified to
                                    see the problem and to build your Solution.
                                </dd>

                                <dd>
                                    An effective elevator pitch stays at a fairly high level and
                                    does not go into too much unnecessary detail.
                                </dd>

                                <dd>
                                    As much as is possible, an effective elevator pitch is also
                                    specific and tangible.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Customized</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    An effective elevator pitch addresses the specific interests and
                                    concerns of the audience.
                                </dd>

                                <dd>
                                    Every version of an effective elevator pitch conveys the same
                                    basic message.
                                </dd>

                                    Rather than being to close the deal, the goal of an elevator
                                    pitch is to just set the hook; to start a conversation, or
                                    dialogue, with the audience.

                                    are so intuitive to use that people don’t need instructions or
                                    training to use them. I do this for a wide variety of

                                Create a 100-250 word pitch (about 60 to 90 seconds of spoken dialog) for an idea that you would like to turn into a website. You can use the following process to help:

                                Once you have put your pitch together and practiced it, share it with 3-4 people and get their feedback. These people can be anyone you think will give good feedback to you, but this sharing must be done synchronously; a face to face conversation or video conference ideally. After sharing and getting feedback upload your pitch and the feedback to the Elevator Pitch assignment in Canvas.

                            This video starts a bit cringey but teaches the concept of personal elevator pitches in a succinct way. This video is more about how to network, socialize, and land a job interview in a professional way. Avoid high fluctuations in your voice and sentences so fast the person can hear you gasp for air.
