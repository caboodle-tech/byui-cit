                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a two-credit course you are expected to spend approximately 4-6 hours each week completing the homework assignments. Do not plan otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself. Set aside time throughout the week to complete your assignments and challenge yourself by completing stretch challenges as time permits.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Textbook</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is no textbook for this course. However, because many of the readings and assignments are online, students are recommended to have a steady internet connection.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Schedule</h2>
                    <p>
                        Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be given notification of any changes; check Canvas (I-Learn) and your student email frequently. You should check the course schedule each day to determine when things are due.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Howework</h2>
                    <p>
                        There will be weekly assignments due over the course of the semester. Many of these exercises build off of each other. It is important that you do not fall behind. Pay attention to Canvas for the specific dates and times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due dates should be considered <mark>end dates</mark> for this course. End dates usually denote when an assignment is locked and no longer available for completion. This course is not designed with end date locks but your instructor reserves the right to add them at any time. Students should start assignments <strong>well before</strong> the stated due date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Activities are not accepted via email. You must submit your activities in the correct place and within the posted timeframe.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Canvas (I-Learn)</h2>
                    <p>
                        All of the activity instructions and assignments can be found in Canvas. Make sure to spend some time learning how to make the most of Canvas. Submitting assignments, checking your progress in the course and knowing how to see feedback from the instructor are all crucial things to know. Here are a couple of links you should check out if you are unsure about any of these things:

                    <h2>Required Software</h2>
                    <p>
                        All of the software we will be using specifically for this course can be used for free. See the <a href="week-1/setup.html">Software Setup</a> page and course announcements for more details.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Final Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        The final project for this course consists of two primary phases. The first is the design of a complete 3 page web site on a topic of your choosing. This design will be organized and submitted in a detailed Site Plan. The second phase is the construction of the website in HTML and CSS. The Final Project grade will collectively be worth 30% of your grade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project will be due according to the due date on the Calendar. Due to the submission date for the project being near the last day of the semester, late submissions will not be accepted. Therefore, if you do not turn in your final project on time, you may automatically fail the course.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Overall Grading</h2>
                    <p>
                        The final percentage will determine your grade as follows:
                    </p>
                    <table>
