                        Each of the collapsed sections below contains text content for a page in your final project website. This text content has very limited formatting. It will be your job to place the content into the correct spots in your project, add appropriate HTML elements, and CSS styling. You will have to write some of your own content. Make sure any content you add fits with the style and flow of the website. Using only this content in your final project site will keep you from getting top marks. Be creative and apply yourself to the final project site.
