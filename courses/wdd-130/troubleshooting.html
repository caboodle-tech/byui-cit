                    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
                    <p>
                        Anyone who writes code or creates software will eventually master the art of troubleshooting. Often we will run into two questions when we write code: <em>Why is this not working?</em> and <em>How is this working?</em>. The first question (why) is what builds our troubleshooting skills and the second (how) is what helps us become troubleshooting masters. In this article we will share with you some of the common mistakes developers make and the troubleshooting skills to fix them.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
                    <p>
                        How you name things matters. Well not always true, it's safe to assume anything you code or name is case sensitive. Here is an example of 3 different file names. They all have the same spelling but are considered different because of case sensitivity:
                    </p>
<pre class="lang-text"><code>hello.txt
Hello.txt
HeLlo.txt
</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Technically speaking CSS <mark>id</mark> and <mark>class</mark> names are case-insensitive but there are exceptions to this rule so it is best to stick to the same case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When coding make sure to look up the correct naming conventions for the language your using. In previous versions of HTML for example, <mark>id</mark>'s could not start with a number.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Correct File Extensions</h2>
                    <p>
                        How you save a file is just as important as how you name it. If your working with an HTML file but fail to save it with the <mark>.html</mark> extension, web browsers will not be able to load the file correctly. The same goes with all types of files. A common mistake new developers make is using the incorrect file extension for the type of file they are working with. For example saving a stylesheet file with the <mark>.html</mark> extension instead of the <mark>.css</mark> extension.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Correct File Locations</h2>
                    <p>
                        If a resource or page fails to load it often means the file is missing. On a website this often triggers a <mark>404</mark> error. This could mean you forgot to upload a file or your trying to access a file in the incorrect location. Make sure all the files you expect to be present actual are. Next check that your accessing or linking to the file in the correct location. The following video may help. If you still have issues do an internet search on absolute vs relative file paths.

                    </a>
                    <h2>Incorrect or Missing Closures</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another common mistake new developers make is using incorrect closures; or leaving the closure out altogether. In HTML for example we often have opening tags that require a closing tag (closure). Here is an example of an improperly and properly closed paragraph tag:
                    </p>
<pre class="lang-html"><code>&lt;p&gt;Improperly Closed&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly Closed&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Improper closures can happen anywhere in your code. A common one is forgetting the semicolon <kbd>;</kbd> or the closing curly bracket <kbd>}</kbd> in languages that require it like JavaScript or CSS rules and rule sets.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Not Validating Code</h2>
                    <p>
                        New web developers often forget to validate their code or ask for help to quickly. With modern tools code validation is an easy process every developer should become familiar with. Here is an example of the troubleshooting steps a web developer might take to find and fix an error:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="smaller">
                        <li>
                            Make sure there are no red or yellow lines in your editor. Red lines or marks indicate the editor detected an error that needs fixing. Yellow is calling your attention to something but is not necessarily an error.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the file your working on is accessible in a web browser open the web browser inspector <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> (or right click and choose <em>inspect</em>) and see if the <mark>console</mark> tab is showing any errors. Do an internet search to find help on what this error means.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use a validation service that will detect errors and offer recommendations to you. For HTML files you can use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> and for CSS files you can use the <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C CSS Validation Service</a>. There is also the <a href="https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECMAScript Syntax Validator</a> for JavaScript.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
