                    <h1>Colors</h1>
                    <p>
                        Colors are one of the key cornerstones to proper User Experience (UX). The colors you choose for your website will have a massive impact on how users perceive and interact with your site. As you will learn in this course colors play several key roles, for example they help with visual contrast or the readability of your site, they can also set a tone or mood helping a visitor feel or react a certain way. Colors are a subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, way to communicate something to the visitors of your site. You also need to keep user accessibility in mind when working with colors. Your sight might look great to you but a visually impaired user could have a drastically different opinion, especially if clashing colors or dim colors make the site unusable for them.

                    <p>

                    <h2>CSS Color In Practice</h2>
                    <p>
                        The following video provides you with a brief introduction to creating CSS code for colors. During this course you will be shown several times how to do this. If you have not practiced with the following CSS rules, remember that <code>background</code> is a shorthand property allowing you to provide multiple background rules at once, color is one of the properties you can assign with <code>background</code>. To specifically apply only a background color you should use the <code>background-color</code> rule instead. To change the font (text) color use the <code>color</code> rule. You can do an internet search for <em>W3Schools CSS Colors<em> if you would like to learn more about the CSS color rules.
