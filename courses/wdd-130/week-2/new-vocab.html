                    <p>
                        Last week you were introduced to some of the most important terms you need to know about HTML and CSS. This week we want to highlight some new terms that are important for web development in general. Please work on memorizing these terms. You will be quizzed at the end of the week on these terms and other material from this week.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Assignment</h2>

                            <p>
                                Make sure you have read, understood, and memorized the following terms:
                            </p>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>
                                    A (Anchor)

                                    The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. This tag has also been called the anchor tag or back tag because it links (anchors) back to other resources on the internet.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>

                                    The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag defines the document's body and contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>

                                        A distribution system on the Internet that accelerates the delivery of web pages, audio, video and other Internet-based content to users around the world

                                        When content is replicated throughout the country or the world, it is delivered to users with greater speed and reliability. The CDN network routes the user's request for content to the appropriate caching server based on the user's location.

                                            This summarized definition comes from the <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDN definition entry</a> by PCMAG. You should visit the link for the full entry and to learn more about CDN's.

                                    In the context of web development <em>external</em> refers to an external file. Often we will <code>link</code> to external style sheets and script files. This allows developers to keep code files separate and easily manageable, web browsers will then treat all the separate files as a single file.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Font Weight
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    The <code>font-weight</code> property sets how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Head
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>
                                        The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag at the top of your HTML document.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a container for the following elements: <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Inline
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    In the context of web development <em>inline</em> refers to styles or scripts added directly inline with an HTML element. Because this type of code is difficult to maintain it should be used sparingly or avoided altogether. Here are some examples of inline code:
<pre class="lang-html"><code>&lt;h1 style="color:blue;"&gt;A Blue Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;A Red Paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div onclick="runFun();"&gt;A div that reacts to being clicked on.&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Internal
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    In the context of web development <em>internal</em> refers to styles or scripts added inside (internal to) the file they are used in. Well this convenient for small style rules or scripts, it makes maintaining and updating code harder. External files should be used as much as possible.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Link
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>
                                        The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource; it is most often used to link to external style sheets.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Meta
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>
                                        The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags always go inside the &lt;head&gt; element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    Style Sheet
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages at once. A CSS (style sheet) file should be saved with the <mark>.css</mark> file extension.
                                </dd>
                            </dl>
